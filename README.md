# pithy.af (version 6)

Built for [Front End Center Episode 16â€”Snapshot Rendering: The Sweet Spot for JS Apps](https://frontend.center/ep16-snapshot-rendering-the-sweet-spot-for-js-apps). This is the first time the codebase has gone beyond a simple placeholder and is starting to look like a real app.

Changes between v5 and v6 (not covered by the episode)

* Connecting to an API that's serving the quote data
* Routing: a page per author, per work, and per quote.
